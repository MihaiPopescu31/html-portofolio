<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With over eight years in the automotive industry, I have honed my expertise in accounts receivable optimization and SAP, supported by a Master's in Computer Engineering from ULBS.
Preparing for a transition into the IT field, I have developed strong proficiency in C++ and Python, including libraries like Pandas, Tkinter, and Selenium.
I am also skilled in web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and version control using Git, along with SQL, Jira, and testing tools such as Postman, Cypress, and JMeter.</p>

<p>I am eager to pivot to a technology-focused role where I can leverage my programming skills and technical expertise.</p>
